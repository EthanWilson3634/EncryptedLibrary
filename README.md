# EncryptedLibrary
I designed a program that saves and encrypts a text file locally on the host that runs it. The text file contains accounts and each account contains three text fields. The idea was to store username and passwords for different accounts and applications. The user should be able to add, remove, display, and sort the accounts in a small gui.
